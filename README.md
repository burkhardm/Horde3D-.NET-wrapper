Horde3D .NET wrapper
====================
Version: 0.13.0 rc2<br/>
Release: 4th December 2007<br/>

About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Horde3D .NET wrapper is a light-weight open source library, implemented in C# 2.0 for [Horde3D](http://www.horde3d.org), a small open source 3D rendering engine.
The intention is to open the simple and intuitive interface of the next-generation engine Horde3D to the .NET community.

See the [Horde3D SDK documentation](http://www.horde3d.org/docs/manual.html) for descriptions of all the Horde3D .NET Wrapper functions. 
You should have a look at the included samples Chicago .NET and Knight.NET for some examples of how to use Horde3D .NET in your own programs.
